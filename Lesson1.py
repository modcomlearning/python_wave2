# int - whole numbers +/-
# floats - numbers with decimals   +/-
# variable - used to store values
# Variable syntax  -  variable_name = value
# Rules when coming up with variable name like x, y, z
# R1: Use a meaningful word
# R2: do not ue spaces in a a variable name, use underscore
# R3: variable names are CASE SENSITIVE  ,  Max, MAX, max are different
# R4: do not start with a number  , ... 1age not okay , age1 is oaky
